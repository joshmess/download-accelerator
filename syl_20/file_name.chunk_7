 Internet nodes to request and offer services (e.g.,
          access web pages, send emails, etc.). We will then move down the OSI
          model to consider the transport and network layers, with focus on
          understanding the UDP and TCP protocols, flow and congestion control,
          and the IP and routing protocols. Next we will consider the link and
          physical layers. Finally, we will discuss topics related to Network
          Security, such as spoofing, poisoning, Firewalls, etc.&nbsp; <br>
