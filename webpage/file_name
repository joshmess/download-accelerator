          <br>The Internet has become a fundamental component of modern life. An
          increasingly large number of people rely on the Internet to
          communicate with one another, search for information on the most
          diverse topics, do business, find and purchase goods, etc. This course
          focuses on how the Internet works. We will start by viewing the
          Internet for what it really is, namely a large number of
          interconnected computer networks, and analyze how devices connect to
          the Internet to exchange information. We will first analyze some of
          the most important application protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, DNS,
          etc., that enable Internet nodes to request and offer services (e.g.,
          access web pages, send emails, etc.). We will then move down the OSI
          model to consider the transport and network layers, with focus on
          understanding the UDP and TCP protocols, flow and congestion control,
          and the IP and routing protocols. Next we will consider the link and
          physical layers. Finally, we will discuss topics related to Network
          Security, such as spoofing, poisoning, Firewalls, etc.&nbsp; <br>
          <br> 
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Prerequisite Knowledge</span>: The class
          projects will require a good knowledge of the Python programming language. Furthermore, most
          projects will be based on code written mainly for Linux systems,
          therefore good familiarity with Linux is also required.<br>

          <br>
          Students will be evaluated using the following criteria:<br>
          <br>
          Paper Presentations = 15%<br>
          Assignments and Development Projects = 35%<br>
          Exams = 50%<br>
          <br>
          <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Paper Presentations</span></big><br>
          Students will be required to read one or more academic papers, RFCs,
          and other network protocol documentation, as assigned by the
          instructor, and present the topic to class. <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">NOTE</span>: some
          of the topics discussed in the assigned papers and RFCs will be part
          of the midterm and final exams.<br>
          <br>
          <big style="font-weight: bold;">Assignments and Development
          Projects</big><br>Throughout the course, students will be required to
          complete a number of development projects. Some development projects
          must be conducted individually, while others may be conducted in pairs
          (the instructor will indicate which ones in class). The projects will
          focus on network programming in Linux using Python. Other assignments will focus on the analysis
          of network traffic traces. Each successfully completed assignment
          will be attributed <span style="font-style: italic;">X</span>
          points, where <span style="font-style: italic;">X</span> will vary
          depending on assignment difficulty.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">IMPORTANT</span>:
          development projects may be evaluated using a binary criteria:
          "program works correctly" = max points; "program does not work
          according to specifications" = 0 points. Possible exceptions to this
          rule will be announced during class.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">LATENESS
          POLICY</span>: Students are allowed at most one late submission
          throughout the semester, and the late submission must be received no
          more than 3 days past the deadline. If this threshold is exceeded, all
          late assignments will be penalized 100% (i.e., 0 points).<br>
          <br>

          <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Midterm and Final
          Exams</span></big><br>

          The midterm exam will include topics covered up to the exam date. The
          final exam may include all the topics studied during the entire
          course, with more emphasis on topics covered during the second half of
          the term. Both the midterm and final exams may include topics from the
          academic papers assigned for review.<br>
          <br>

          <big><span style="font-weight: bold; color:maroon">Adjustments due to Covid-19</span></big><br>
  
            The course will be conducted mostly synchronously, with hybrid
            in-person and online streaming lectures (via Zoom). Asynchronous lectures may
            also be used if/when necessary. <br>
            Projects and other assignments will be submitted via eLC.
            Exams will be conducted exclusively online. More information related
            to the technical details of how exams are to be conducted will be
            provided during the course.<br>
